# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has a critical issue where user settings, particularly language preferences, do not persist across app refreshes or restarts. Users select their preferred language and other settings, but these choices are lost when the app is refreshed, causing a poor user experience and forcing users to reconfigure their preferences repeatedly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my language preference to persist across app sessions, so that I don't have to change it every time I refresh or restart the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a language preference THEN the system SHALL save this preference to persistent storage immediately
2. WHEN the app is refreshed or restarted THEN the system SHALL load and apply the previously saved language preference
3. WHEN no language preference has been previously saved THEN the system SHALL use a sensible default based on user's browser/device locale
4. WHEN the language preference is loaded THEN the system SHALL apply it to the UI direction (RTL/LTR) and text content immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my settings to persist across app sessions, so that my personalized configuration is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes any setting in the settings screen THEN the system SHALL save the change to persistent storage immediately
2. WHEN the app is refreshed or restarted THEN the system SHALL load all previously saved settings and apply them to the app state
3. WHEN settings fail to load THEN the system SHALL use default values and log the error appropriately
4. WHEN settings are successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL update all relevant UI components to reflect the loaded preferences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to initialize with my saved preferences quickly, so that I don't see incorrect settings or UI flashing during startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load user preferences before rendering the main UI
2. WHEN preferences are being loaded THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate loading state
3. WHEN preferences loading takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL proceed with defaults after a reasonable timeout
4. WHEN preferences are loaded THEN the system SHALL apply them synchronously to prevent UI flashing or incorrect initial states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings to be synchronized between the different storage systems used in the app, so that there are no conflicts or inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN settings are updated through any interface THEN the system SHALL update both the Zustand store and SettingsService consistently
2. WHEN there are conflicts between different storage systems THEN the system SHALL use a defined precedence order to resolve conflicts
3. WHEN settings are loaded on app startup THEN the system SHALL ensure all storage systems are synchronized with the same values
4. WHEN a storage system fails to save or load THEN the system SHALL fallback to alternative storage methods gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper internationalization (i18n) system to replace hardcoded language handling, so that the app can be easily maintained and extended with additional languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing language support THEN the system SHALL use a proper i18n library instead of hardcoded translation objects
2. WHEN language is changed THEN the system SHALL update all text content through the i18n system automatically
3. WHEN adding new translatable text THEN the system SHALL use i18n keys instead of hardcoded strings
4. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL initialize the i18n system with the user's saved language preference
5. WHEN a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to a default language gracefully
6. WHEN supporting RTL languages THEN the system SHALL handle text direction changes through the i18n system
