# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a shared, reusable location component that consolidates location handling logic currently duplicated across prayer times, qibla compass, and mosque finder features. The shared component will provide a consistent user experience for location selection and management while reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Location Selection Interface

**User Story:** As a Muslim user, I want a consistent location selection experience across all app features, so that I don't have to repeatedly set my location for different functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses any location-dependent feature THEN the system SHALL display a unified location selection interface
2. WHEN the user sets their location in one feature THEN the system SHALL automatically apply it to all other location-dependent features
3. WHEN the user changes their location THEN the system SHALL update all dependent features simultaneously
4. WHEN the location component is displayed THEN the system SHALL show current location status (GPS, manual, or not set)
5. WHEN the user has previously set a location THEN the system SHALL display it with appropriate status indicators

### Requirement 2: GPS and Manual Location Options

**User Story:** As a Muslim user, I want to choose between automatic GPS location detection and manual location entry, so that I can use the app regardless of my device's GPS capabilities or privacy preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects GPS location THEN the system SHALL request location permissions and attempt to get current coordinates
2. WHEN GPS location is successful THEN the system SHALL display the location with a GPS indicator
3. WHEN GPS location fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to manual entry
4. WHEN the user selects manual location THEN the system SHALL open a location input interface
5. WHEN manual location is set THEN the system SHALL display it with a manual indicator
6. WHEN the user wants to switch between GPS and manual THEN the system SHALL provide easy toggle options

### Requirement 3: Location Status and Management

**User Story:** As a Muslim user, I want to see my current location status and easily manage location settings, so that I can ensure accurate prayer times and directions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location is set via GPS THEN the system SHALL display "GPS Location" status with green indicator
2. WHEN location is set manually THEN the system SHALL display "Manual Location" status with orange indicator
3. WHEN no location is set THEN the system SHALL display "Location not set" with appropriate call-to-action
4. WHEN location is being updated THEN the system SHALL show loading state with spinner
5. WHEN location update succeeds THEN the system SHALL show success feedback briefly
6. WHEN location update fails THEN the system SHALL display error message with retry options

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a Muslim user, I want clear error messages and alternative options when location services fail, so that I can still use the app effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location permission is denied THEN the system SHALL display permission explanation and manual location option
2. WHEN GPS is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show unavailable message and manual location fallback
3. WHEN location request times out THEN the system SHALL provide timeout message and retry option
4. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use cached location data if available
5. WHEN any location error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear next steps for the user

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shared location component to integrate seamlessly with existing prayer times, qibla compass, and mosque finder features, so that the refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prayer times feature uses shared location THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing prayer time calculation accuracy
2. WHEN qibla compass uses shared location THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing direction calculation accuracy
3. WHEN mosque finder uses shared location THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing search functionality
4. WHEN location changes in shared component THEN the system SHALL notify all dependent features to update
5. WHEN shared component is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing user preferences and settings
